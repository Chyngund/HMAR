## Usage

To use the HMAR model for image generation, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Model**:

   ```python
   from hmar import HMARModel
   ```

2. **Load Pre-trained Weights**:

   Load the model with pre-trained weights:

   ```python
   model = HMARModel.from_pretrained('path_to_weights')
   ```

3. **Generate Images**:

   Use the model to generate images:

   ```python
   generated_image = model.generate(input_data)
   ```

4. **Display the Generated Image**:

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.imshow(generated_image)
   plt.axis('off')
   plt.show()
   ```

## Model Architecture

The HMAR model employs a hierarchical structure that allows for the generation of images at multiple scales. The architecture is built on vision transformers, which provide a robust framework for understanding complex visual data.

### Key Components:

- **Encoder**: Processes input images and extracts features.
- **Decoder**: Generates images based on encoded features.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the image.

## Training

Training the HMAR model requires a well-structured dataset. Follow these steps for training:

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format.
2. **Configure Training Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the `config.py` file.
3. **Run Training Script**:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.py
   ```

Monitor the training process through logs to ensure the model converges properly.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance using the following steps:

1. **Load the Trained Model**:

   ```python
   model = HMARModel.load_from_checkpoint('path_to_checkpoint')
   ```

2. **Evaluate on Test Set**:

   Use the evaluation script to assess the model's performance:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model model --test_data test_dataset
   ```

3. **Metrics**: The evaluation will provide metrics such as FID score and Inception score to quantify image quality.
